    <p>Tracking points along a line in D3.js usually involves using the d3.scale used to plot the points onto the chart. However, when non-linear paths (i.e., non-linear interpolations) are used to connect points, the d3.scale coordinates often do not not fall along the rendered path. Below I explored three different ways to have effective point tracking when using non-linear interpolations.<p>

<div class="row 9u important(collapse)">
    <p><i>For every move of the mouse, search for the closest point among all points on the chart. With fewer lines displayed, performance is enhanced.</i><p>
</div>

<div class="row 9u important(collapse)">
    <p><i>Areas of the chart are tied to the closest line for that area. When the mouse moves to a new area, the closest point on that area's line is computed. Note that now we only have to search the data points for one line, rather than points for all lines.</i><p>
</div>

<div class="row 9u important(collapse)">
    <p><i>Areas of the chart are tied to the closest line for that area. The closest point for each area is precomputed and stored so that there are no on-the-fly, closest point searches. Smooth!</i><p>
