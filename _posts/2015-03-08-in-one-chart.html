		Information Design is playing an increasingly critical role in everyday journalism. The movement from word and picture to “words within diagrams” is building a new form of truth-telling and storytelling — and with it, a new journalistic aesthetic.

        A "movement from word and picture to 'words within diagrams'" in journalism means a movement for both journalists and readers. For jouranlists, it's the movement towards a better mapping between information and their medium. For readers, it's a movement toward learning the heuristics to discern visual truths from visual lies.

        In wanting to explore D3.js and (brief) trends in information design in jouralism, I <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=images&vertical=default&q=%22in%20one%20chart%22&src=typd">scraped Twitter</a> for images that claimed to expalin something "in one chart". Below is a look into the prevalence of the practice in early 2015.

        However fun it was to strap into Twitter's API and D3.js (e.g., getting rid of repeat instances of images), I shouldn't overstate the result: the above image is simply an image. It's not an informative graphic. Though it might demand attention, there are not really any 'words' to read in it. To go beyond an information graphic, I'd need more data; I'd need to set up some Twitter dedicated CRON job to hit their API up to my rate limit as often as possible.

        Nah. I'll stick my goal of learning more D3.js with these existing, <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets">awesome data sets</a>.
