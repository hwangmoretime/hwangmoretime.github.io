    There is a trend of articles claiming to explain things <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=images&vertical=default&q=%22in%20one%20chart%22&src=typd">"in one chart"</a>. The trend makes sense: we're in a complex world and someone out there has at least made sense of a small slice of it. And look, all it takes is one chart.
    <br><br>
    But really, looking at each individual chart is too much effort. Imagine what you can learn from seeing all the "in one chart" charts in a single chart?

    I kid; though, I'm more concerned about what I see as a reductionist trend, especially in a burgeoning field like data journalism. I'm concerned about the (deceitful) charts that are still to come that mirror data visualizations of years past:

    This is all to say data literacy is a real need. For an increasingly used medium in todays news, public understanding of these new mediums should ideally increase in lock step. I don't have much context on recent efforts to increase data literacy, but if you have ideas or know of something, let me and Quora know:
