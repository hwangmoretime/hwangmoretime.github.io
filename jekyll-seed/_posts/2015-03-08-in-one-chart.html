		Information Design is playing an increasingly critical role in everyday journalism. The movement from word and picture to “words within diagrams” is building a new form of truth-telling and storytelling — and with it, a new journalistic aesthetic.

        A "movement from word and picture to 'words within diagrams'" in journalism means a movement for both journalists and readers. For jouranlists, it's the movement towards a better mapping between information and their medium. For readers, it's a movement toward learning the heuristics to discern visual, fuzzy truths from visual, damn lies.

   			Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the leader of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, was shown a PowerPoint slide in Kabul last summer that was meant to portray the complexity of American military strategy, but looked more like a bowl of spaghetti.

			“When we understand that slide, we’ll have won the war,” General McChrystal dryly remarked, one of his advisers recalled, as the room erupted in laughter.

        Under Lupi's description of Information Design in journalism, the above image is simply an image. Though it might demand attention, it does not really offer a peak at some sort of truth. There aren't really any 'words' to read in this diagram.
