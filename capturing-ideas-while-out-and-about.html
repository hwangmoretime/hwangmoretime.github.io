  My personal notebook + wallet combo. About the size of a smartphone. I bought it here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KGMDJQJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon link</a>.

<p>Similar to a process described by Andy Matuschak<label for="sn-andy-notepad" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-andy-notepad" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5FKgZAnMhS73t9kenbVUYx23CHSQAE1gKxVf"><em>Pocket memo pad to capture into writing inbox while out</em></a></span>, I carry a pocket notebook when I'm out and about to capture ideas. These notes later get transfered to my computer and expanded upon. I used to use a phone to capture these transient thoughts, but switched to a notebook for two reasons: social misunderstandings &amp; inefficiency.</p>
<p>Social misunderstandings occurred when others mistook my phone-based note taking for disinterest or distraction. This got bothersome enough that I started explaining why I was taking out my phone, but doing that awkwardly interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p>Inefficiency came when trying to compose text and <em>diagrams</em>. Using a phone for diagramming has always felt encumbered and slow. Inefficiency also came through distraction by the notifications that I would see while capturing a thought. Even worse, after taking out my phone, it continued as a peripheral distraction by just being out.</p>
<p>While I've been generally happy with my pocket notebook, I've looked into a couple alternatives in the past couple months. I've toyed with carrying around an iPad &amp; stylus instead, but remain against it. I don't want to add another thing that I need to carry. Also, I think the aforementioned social misunderstandings would still occur. In a similar vein, I did a short search for an "auto-transcribe-to-the-cloud" smart pen, which ideally would speed up the time for transferring writings out of my pocket notebook. I found the Neo Smartpen<label for="sn-neo-smartpen" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-neo-smartpen" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.neosmartpen.com/en/"><em>Neo Smartpen</em></a>. It requires you to use a specialized paper, but they provide relatively affordable notebooks and print-your-own PDFs for their speicalized paper.</span>, but I haven't yet felt that my current transcription process is too toilsome.</p>
<p>A few parting thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>For those that want to continue to use their phones for capturing transient thoughts, I recommend enabling Notes to be directly accessible from the lock screen. This reduces the friction to start writing and reduces the chance of getting distracted.</li>
<li>I have only started using my notebook since Winter, so I haven't felt the annoyance of taking a bulkier wallet with me around with me during the Summer when I'm wearing fewer jackets and more shorts.</li>
</ul>
