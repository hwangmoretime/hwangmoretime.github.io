    I'm David Hwang. I work as a software engineer and will soon live in Boston, MA after spending most of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area.

    I work at Stripe on the machine learning infrastructure team. I'm currently on a tools-for-thought kick, mostly stemming from a masters I did at Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction institute.
